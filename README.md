# JustCodePlz
Code and example collection. we need code not explain.

## Introduce
When you are developing a game, you usually google something. but there are just only code in stackoverflow or some page, so you have to copy and paste that then test it. This page serve not only a code but also an example gif. so you can quickly recognize whether it's the code you want. Beside I write some tutorial about unity3d in Korean.
